*Ensure you have the latest version of Android studio (Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1 preferrably) before cloning this repository.*

This is a simple android application that displays a list of movies.
In this app, at the top of the screen, there is a text field that can be used to search for movies from the local database.

## Dependencies
1) Room
2) RxAndroid/RxJava
3) Jetpack Pagination library
4) Jetpack Compose

## How it works

The UI of this app was created using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial). 
I also used [Jetpack Pagination 3 library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) (and RxJava)
to get the list of movies from https://www.themoviedb.org/ , save them to the local room database and display them in the UI in a paginated manner.

## Architecture
While developing this app, I used the Clean Architectural pattern as a guideline to organize the code base into three distint layers: 
Presentation layer, Domain layer and Data layer.

## Modules
The app contains three main modules:
1) ```features```: This module serves as the presentation layer of the app. It contains the UI related logic.
2) ```domain```: The domain module is a bridge between the data module and the features module. It contains all usecases needed for the app to function.
3) ```data```: The data module serves as the data layer of the app. It contains repositories and other related class needed to get and save data.

## Tests
The code base contains unit tests and UI tests. These can be found here:

Database Instrumented unit test: https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/traction/blob/master/core/database/src/androidTest/java/com/example/database/LocalSourceInstrumentedTest.kt

ViewModel unit test: https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/traction/blob/master/features/movies/src/test/java/com/example/movies/MoviesScreenUnitTest.kt

### Automation Test 
I added an automated UI test using [UiAutomator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/other-components/ui-automator) to launch and verify that the
the expected Composables are visbile when the app is launched.
This automated test can be found here: https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/traction/blob/master/features/movies/src/androidTest/java/com/example/movies/MoviesScreenUiAutomationTest.kt

## Something extra! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
It is very important to monitor the performance of an android app so that issues such as slow startup time and UI jank can be spotted early and resolved.

Because of this, I wrote a [macrobenchmark](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/benchmarking/macrobenchmark-overview) test to monitor the startup time
of the app.

This test can be found here:
https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/traction/blob/master/benchmark/src/main/java/com/example/benchmark/TractionStartupBenchmark.kt

## CI/CD
Yes, the app has CI/CD setup. I used [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/) for this. 
The build config.yml file can be found here: https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/traction/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml

When a new code is pushed to the repo, my CircleCi setup will run *unit tests* and then *build* the apk file.
